# Eloquence

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/farion/eloquence.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/farion/eloquence)

This is an alternative XMPP/Jabber instant messenger for Mac OSX and iOS written in Swift. It was created as an alternative to Adium, which is not actively developed anymore and also is based on libpurple, which does not contain the newest XMPP features. Also it adresses the lack of a good client for iOS ... with mod_push, which is available for ejabberd it makes sense to do that now.

OSX and iOS version is developed in parallel.

Thanks to the [XMPPFramework](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XMPPFramework "XMPPFramework") which is the base of Eloquence.

It is not planned to develop clients for other platforms.
As for Android there is the outstanding [Conversations](https://conversations.im "Conversations") and for Windows and Linux there is [Gajim](https://gajim.org/ "Gajim").

It is also not planned to add other protocols beneath XMPP.

So come on. Join and fork us.

TODO
====

* Support urn:xmpp:mam:1 and urn:xmpp:mam:tmp. Currently only urn:xmpp:mam:0 works. Should be no big deal.
* Do fuzzy message merging.
* Use XEP-0359 for message merging if available. Do this in separate folder, to keep XEPs separated.
* Pull this back to XMPPFramework as soon as possible.
